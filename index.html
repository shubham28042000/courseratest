	The line section connecting the hoisting drum to the crown block is described as the 'fast line'. Thus, during hoisting operations the drum spools much more line than the distance travelled by the travelling block. The speed of the fast line is equal to the number of lines strung times the speed of the travelling block. The crown block must be positioned such that the fast-line sheave is close to the centre line of the hoisting drum. The angle formed by the fast line and the vertical is described as the fleet angle (Figure 3.1).
